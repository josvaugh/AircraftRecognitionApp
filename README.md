# cs49000-aircraft-recognition

## Description
This repository is made for a web application designed to accept a photo from users and determine the model of aircraft in the picture. It will run the photo against a trained model, and return the type of aircraft back to the client.

## Setup
To handle dependencies, the application.py file can be run from CodeRunner. Visiting the localhost address provided in the terminal output will open the application.

## Project Responsibilities
### Amos
Created front-end interface, made deep neural network learn on our dataset and connect to front end.

### Darren
Research learning models and try to apply cats vs. dogs based kernels for our application.

### Joseph
Research models and obtain deep neural network model. Apply DNN to our dataset.

### Sharath
Manage photo base, use download scripting to obtain ~4,000 photos
